# Strava Stats

Quick little project to generate some descriptive statistics,
light analysis, and plots from bulk downloads of Strava files (`.gpx`)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

I would recommend working with [virtualenv/virtualenvwrapper][http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/#virtualenvwrapper] to keep dependencies clean.

Clone the repo from Git

```
git clone https://github.com/tdlangland/strava-stats.git
```

Run `setup.py` from the cloned directory

```
python setup.py install
```

### Usage

A couple data files are included to test on, in case you don't have
your own yet.
